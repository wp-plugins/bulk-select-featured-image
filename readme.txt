Allows you to select Featured Image / post thumbnail for your posts directly from the media library view.

== Description ==

This plugin adds an "Use as Featured Image"-action to the Media Library. Very useful if you need to set the post thumbnail / featured image for a lot of posts.

If you value [my plugins](http://profiles.wordpress.org/users/ulfben/), please help me out by [Flattr-ing them](http://flattr.com/thing/367557/Support-my-WordPress-plugins)! Or perhaps [send me a book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2QB6SQ5XX2U0N/105-3209188-5640446?reveal=unpurchased&filter=all&sort=priority&layout=standard&x=11&y=10)? Used ones are fine! :)
