Allows you to select Featured Image / post thumbnail for your posts directly from the media library view.

== Description ==

This plugin adds an "Use as Featured Image"-action to the Media Library. Very useful if you need to set the post thumbnail / featured image for a lot of posts. 

[A picture says more than a thousand words](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bulk-select-featured-image/screenshots/).
